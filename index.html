        <p class="p1"> It might be debatable topic, but i am proud to be a fellow metacognitive person ( nerd face hehe ) to anouce that SEX, yes sex is a logical inherited fellacy which had one purpose, given to humankind
for produce progeny but we turns this to like as flies attracted to halogen bulb. i know it's all you testosteron!
c'mon people wake up it's a loophole, it's acting as inhibitor to our race. remmember what we are here for,
space,cosmos , immortality!

        <h3>more thoughts</h3>
        <p class="p2">It's like an episode, more precisely the series of episodes full of thriller, suspense, hopes and to whom of course the main menu. Every time one episode ended, it's leaves out with suspense to watch the next. it's makes you feel like you're the part of it. Yes the stalking, the stalking to your past remains. You know, you don't have any option other than to watch and accept the play. But whola on a bonus you have the judgement to decide to whom you want to make hero..</p>
